# cs103aPA04

# For this project we recreated our PA04 app as an express app using Mongobdb. We added all of our trasactions from the demo we used in class and added a sortBy query parameter: ?sortBy=category and returns to the same page except the category column. There is a sortBuy for each transaction and a groupBy for category. After this we were able to create a nice webpage of the transaction app with the sortBy query. It also allows you to add, delete, edit transactions and to sort by any column and to group by the category column.
